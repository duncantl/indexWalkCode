Package: indexWalkCode
Title: Walk R code with ability to query up the tree and sideways
Description: # This is an experiment in creating a version of walkCode() from codetools
 that allows us to collect indices if elements in the AST that match some criteria.
 The intent is to be able to use these indices to
 a) move up the tree, e.g., to check the parent, ancestors and siblings of a node in the predicate
    or after the traversal, and
 b) modify the AST after the travesal by inserting new/updated language objects at a specific location.
Version: 0.2-0
